## Description
---
A full-stack web application to find groups near you looking for additional people to do a given activity.  Users create an account for full access to the site.  From there, they may find a Campfire (main function), create a Campfire, view Campfires they have matched with, and view Campfires they have created.
    

    
## Installation
---
The live app is deployed on [Heroku](https://secret-bastion-06521.herokuapp.com/)


    
## Usage
---
Users must create an account in order to access the functionality of the site.  From there, all options are listed on the Dashboard, which can be accessed at any time by clicking the Campfire logo on the top left of each screen.  If not logged in, users will be prompted to do so before being directed to the Dashboard.

## Features
---
Create Groups, View Matched Groups, Match With Other Groups

## Future Development
---
Future versions of this app will include a more polished user interface - this is our main priority.  We are also working on location polling instead of relying on user input to determine how to match users with Campfires near them.
